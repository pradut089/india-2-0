## Development Workflow

### For Hackathon Teams (Submissions)

If you're submitting a hackathon project, follow the detailed workflow in [Submission Guidelines](./SUBMISSION_GUIDELINES.md#-git-workflow-for-teams).

**Quick Summary:**
1. Team leader forks the repository
2. Create a branch: `your-team-name`
3. Team members collaborate on the leader's fork
4. Create your submission in `submissions/your-team-name/`
5. Submit PR from your branch (NOT from `main`)

> 💡 **Prefer using GitHub's web interface?** See the [Web Interface Submission Guide](./SUBMISSION_GUIDELINES.md#-submission-using-github-web-interface) for step-by-step instructions.
